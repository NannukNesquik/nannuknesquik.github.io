                    <h1>Game of Life </h1>
                    
                    <p>In this piece, there is a King chess piece present. In chess the king is considered the most important piece, as without it, you lose the game. Just like the King piece if you die your life is over, so the king represents a person. I used the point technique because when you apply tiny dots to an area up close all the details are visible but when you take a step back it all melts together, 
                        just like how when you get to know someone, they also start to become more intricate. The dots themselves portray that you are made up of so many different moments, decisions, preferences etc that make every individual unique. I primarily used the colour yellow this is because the colour yellow is associated with contentment, which I resonate with because I think we should be glad

                    <h1>We Are All The Same</h1>
                    
                    <p>In this piece I have decided to put an arm with exposed muscle. You cannot tell if this person is a male or female, not even their race. This is done because how could you hate someone based on gender or ethnicity, when under our skin we all look the same. The emphasized lines in the muscles going in different directions gives us a sense of life and movement. These lines are what creates a flowing rhythm. The teal-coloured background is in that colour not only because it reminds us of fluidity correspondence to water but also because it contrasts with the colours of the subject, which creates a focal point. </p>

                    <h1>The Sea Turtle</h1>
                    
                    <p>In this piece I have used an organic abstract (doodle) style, it consists of natural forms and a thin singular black line. The use of the organic forms is there to create a connection to nature, which in my case relates to the topic that is being represented. The abstract part of the shapes is what makes the viewer focus more on the meaning and emotion of the subject rather than the physical appearance of it. 
                        My choice of colours is based on colours that often correlate to or are seen in the sea, blue and green. The colour yellow is a colour that sticks out a lot from under the sea so it is a way of symbolizing this topic shouldn’t be buried and should be discussed. After looking at the painting it is obvious what the message is supposed to be, that is water pollution. The sea turtle is a marine animal that is most affected by plastic water pollution, as it often mistakes the plastic for food. The chosen plastic item is a water bottle, due to the reason that is one of the most popular plastic products that is globally used on the daily. The two subjects (water bottle and sea turtle) have a singular black line that connects them, to show that the pollution of water is directly affecting the sea turtle.

                    <h1>The Melting Moment</h1>
                    
                    <p>This piece explores the concept of the preciousness of time. I used the candle as a metaphor for time, as the melting wax drips onto the skin, symbolizing how time is connected to our lives and will inevitably run out. The dark purple background emphasizes the spiritual theme of the painting, as purple is often associated with deeper emotional and spiritual meanings.</p>

                    <p>This piece was created for my mum <strong>Rose</strong>anne. The use of turquoise as the background contrasts with the red of the rose to make it stand out. This focus symbolizes how important my mum is to me and how no other rose can compare to her significance in my life.</p>

                    <h1>Sovereign Art Competition 2023: Drowing in Music</h1>
                    
                    <p>This piece is about the experience of having a panic disorder, symbolizing the intensity and overwhelming nature of a panic attack. The top part of the skull is replaced with a gramophone, a choice to represent how intrusive thoughts and emotions can be as loud and inescapable as amplified sound. The gramophone’s spinning record mirrors the repetitive, looping nature of panic-inducing thoughts, while the vivid, contrasting colours reflect the chaotic and overwhelming energy of a panic episode. The green-coloured stylus, acting as a needle, adds a sense of sharpness and discomfort, emphasizing the distressing sensations associated with such moments. Through this powerful imagery, the piece conveys the sensory overload and relentless nature of panic attacks, offering a visual representation of an often-invisible struggle.</p>

                    <p>This piece is about how when we die it doesn’t matter how loved we were eventually we will be forgotten, it is only a matter of time. The coffin drawn in the middle of the paper with slices coming out of it, this structure creates a focal point, signifying that the coffin is the main subject. Each slice coming out from the centre point represents a different time stamp this is supported from the clock hands. The first quarter is the funeral itself, so all loved ones are seen in that slice. The following quarters have a decrease in people every time. This could be days months or even years after the funeral has been done, it is not specified because what matters is that ultimately you will be slowly forgotten. </p>

                    <p>This piece uses an alternating rhythm to show tension and difference in the path of life. This is done, because life itself is not easy or smooth sailing, but there are a few bumps and alternation in one’s journey. In each part, besides the road being different there is also a change in the look of the grass. Some parts have yellow flowers, and some have red ones, while some don’t have any. This could mean multitudes of things, but most importantly it exhibits change. No matter how different life may look it doesn’t mean you can’t continue and still progress just like this road. </p>

                    <p>In recent times I have developed a love for cooking, it is something that I like to put time into now rather than something I must do to survive. I have put these elements together to creates a sense of proximity, used to show that they all are used for the same thing, because they are essentials for whenever I do decide to cook. Since all play an equal part, they are all equally distant. The chair is spaced further away because it isn't fully related to cooking, but you do use it to eat once the meal is finished.</p>

                    <p>In this piece we see two birds, one is domesticated in a cage while the other is free to fly around. All though both are captured doing about the same thing, there is a mere difference as the one stuck in the cage not only is clearly not pleased with its environment, but as well as sitting on a substitute branch. On the other hand, the free one seems to be more comfortable and, in his element, also taking into consideration that the branch he is going to is real. I made the birds also look in different directions to produce indifference and gave them different colour profile, the one on the right looks more washed compared to the more saturated and brighter colours. This was done to create contrast which in turn produces a story.</p>

                    <p>In this piece, I had to be mindful of the colors I chose, as the abstract style makes it harder to create a sense of depth. By carefully selecting hues and layering them, I was able to maintain depth and ensure the composition remains balanced and engaging.</p>

                    <p>In this piece, I used muted colors in the background to draw attention to the foreground, where bright yellow contrasts with the subtle tones of the landscape. The church, positioned in the bottom left according to the rule of thirds, which further directs the viewer’s focus. The abstract style enhances the loose, tranquil feel of the scene, perfectly complementing the peaceful atmosphere of the setting.</p>

                    <h1>Coming to Terms With Death</h1>
                    
                    <p>In this watercolour piece I have put a skull which is reminiscent of death and decided to use an analogous colour harmony to produce serenity, since the colours in this scheme tend to flow together and easy to look at. The further you investigate colour the more you realise its psychological influence on us. It can affect our mood and choices. Blue is seen as a colour that creates a sense of safety and tranquillity, so I used it to give the impression that death doesn't have to be so scary and paralysing. Purple is often associated with being regal and spiritual. Which could make a person feel compassion and comprehension towards the subject, while also keeping the person grounded.</p>

                    <p>This is my first attempt at an abstract watercolor style, and I love how, despite its simplicity, it still retains form.</p>

                    <h1>Forever Connected</h1>
                    
                    <p>In this piece we can see a tree with two individuals hanging from it, one of which is younger than the other. This makes us reflect on how there is no set age of who might have the desire to do something like this. The tree is used because it is a common symbol of life. Both are now spiritually connected to the tree, seen from how their blood is what it is watering it. Symmetry is used because of the sense of unity it creates. This unity gives us evidence about how we aren’t alone regarding our feelings and should reach out if we ever feel the need to.  </p>
