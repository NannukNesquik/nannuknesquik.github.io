                    <h1>Game of Life </h1>
                    
                    <p>The King chess piece represents a person, as it is the most important in the game; without it, you lose, just like life ends without you. 
                        I used the pointillism technique: up close, the dots reveal intricate details, but from a distance, they blend together, much like getting 
                        to know someone reveals their complexity. Each dot symbolizes the countless moments, decisions, and traits that make every individual unique. 
                        I primarily used yellow, a color tied to contentment, reflecting the belief that we should embrace gratitude and joy in life.

                    <h1>We Are All The Same</h1>
                    
                    <p>In this piece, I depicted an arm with exposed muscles, purposefully disregarding gender, race, or identity. This highlights the idea that beneath our skin, 
                        we are all the same, challenging prejudice based on appearance. The emphasized lines in the muscles, flowing in different directions, evoke a sense of 
                        life and movement, creating a dynamic rhythm. The teal background symbolizes fluidity, reminiscent of water, while also contrasting with the subject’s 
                        colors to draw focus and enhance the composition.
                    </p>

                    <h1>The Sea Turtle</h1>
                    
                    <p>This piece uses an organic abstract (doodle) style, featuring natural forms and a thin black line. The organic shapes evoke a connection to nature, 
                        aligning with the topic, while the abstraction shifts focus to the meaning and emotion rather than physical details. The color palette, blues and 
                        greens, reflects the sea, with yellow symbolizing that this issue should not be buried and must be addressed. The message is clear: water pollution. 
                        A sea turtle, often harmed by plastic pollution, is depicted alongside a water bottle, one of the most commonly used plastics. The singular black 
                        line connecting the two emphasizes how pollution directly impacts marine life.

                    <h1>The Melting Moment</h1>
                    
                    <p>This piece explores the concept of the preciousness of time. I used the candle as a metaphor for time, as the melting wax drips onto the skin, 
                        symbolizing how time is connected to our lives and will inevitably run out. The dark purple background emphasizes the spiritual theme of the 
                        painting, as purple is often associated with deeper emotional and spiritual meanings.

                    <p>This piece was created for my mum <strong>Rose</strong>anne. The use of turquoise as the background contrasts with the red of the rose to make it stand out. 
                        This focus symbolizes how important my mum is to me and how no other rose can compare to her significance in my life.

                    <h1>Sovereign Art Competition 2023: Drowing in Music</h1>
                    
                    <p>This piece is about the experience of having a panic disorder, symbolizing the intensity and overwhelming nature of a panic attack. The top part of the skull 
                        is replaced with a gramophone, a choice to represent how intrusive thoughts and emotions can be as loud and inescapable as amplified sound. The gramophone’s 
                        spinning record mirrors the repetitive, looping nature of panic-inducing thoughts, while the vivid, contrasting colours reflect the chaotic and overwhelming 
                        energy of a panic episode. The green-coloured stylus, acting as a needle, adds a sense of sharpness and discomfort, emphasizing the distressing sensations 
                        associated with such moments. Through this powerful imagery, the piece conveys the sensory overload and relentless nature of panic attacks, offering a 
                        visual representation of an often-invisible struggle.

                        His talent and energy stand out in the bustling streets of the city, drawing the attention of both locals and tourists alike. 
                        The image highlights his connection to the vibrant atmosphere of Valletta, showcasing the charm that makes him a beloved figure.

                        This photo represents finding your person, not romantically, but platonically. I used red yarn to symbolize the deep bond between the two individuals. 
                        I intentionally left out their faces to convey that this connection can happen to anyone, regardless of identity.

                        and used a paper bag as a mask and barrier, symbolizing separation and detachment.

                    <p>In this photo, I captured the irony of a long line in front of Saint John's Cathedral, where visitors wait for an extended period, 
                        only to spend much less time actually viewing the site. It highlights the common experience of tourists being caught in a cycle of 
                        waiting and rushed visits.

                        I took this photo because it's common to see vendors in Valletta selling their work, which is often very beautiful. 
                        I wanted to capture the artistry and craftsmanship they share with passersby.

                        In this piece, I drew a silly cow and used bold colors to enhance its playful nature. To keep the background dynamic, 
                        I made sure the strokes were visible, adding energy and movement to the overall composition.

                    <p>This piece is about how when we die it doesn’t matter how loved we were eventually we will be forgotten, it is only a matter of time. 
                        The coffin drawn in the middle of the paper with slices coming out of it, this structure creates a focal point, 
                        signifying that the coffin is the main subject. Each slice coming out from the centre point represents a different time stamp 
                        this is supported from the clock hands. The first quarter is the funeral itself, so all loved ones are seen in that slice. 
                        The following quarters have a decrease in people every time. This could be days months or even years after the funeral has been done, 
                        it is not specified because what matters is that ultimately you will be slowly forgotten.

                    <p>This piece uses an alternating rhythm to show tension and difference in the path of life. This is done, because life itself is not easy or smooth sailing, 
                        but there are a few bumps and alternation in one’s journey. In each part, besides the road being different there is also a change in the look of the grass. 
                        Some parts have yellow flowers, and some have red ones, while some don’t have any. This could mean multitudes of things, but most importantly it exhibits change. 
                        No matter how different life may look it doesn’t mean you can’t continue and still progress just like this road.

                        This approach allowed me to focus mainly on proportions without committing to a larger piece of paper.

                        I also chose objects with reflections to enhance the challenge. To make the highlights stand out, 
                        I used a white pen for added contrast and detail.

                    <p>This was my first attempt at creating a still life, and I found the process to be incredibly relaxing and enjoyable. 
                        It allowed me to focus on details and develop a deeper appreciation for the subject matter.

                    <p>Recently, I've developed a deep appreciation for cooking, especially the way my grandma used to. It’s no longer just something I do out of necessity, 
                        but something I genuinely enjoy. In this piece, I’ve brought together elements that remind me of her kitchen to create a sense of proximity, 
                        symbolizing that they all serve the same purpose in the cooking process. Each item is placed with equal distance, reflecting how every tool, 
                        from the pot to the spoon, plays an essential role. The chair is positioned further away, as it’s not directly involved in cooking, 
                        but it’s still part of the experience when we gather to enjoy the meal together.

                    <p>
                        In this piece, I used oil pastels for the first time to experiment with color, values, and blending while working on a still life. 
                        This helped me learn and explore the medium's possibilities.

                    <p>In this piece, I purposely arranged objects with reflections to practice drawing the environment visible in those reflections. 
                        This technique, when applied, helps make the artwork look more realistic.

                    <h1>The Two Birds</h1>
                    
                    <p>In this piece we see two birds, one is domesticated in a cage while the other is free to fly around. 
                        All though both are captured doing about the same thing, there is a mere difference as the one stuck 
                        in the cage not only is clearly not pleased with its environment, but as well as sitting on a substitute branch. 
                        On the other hand, the free one seems to be more comfortable and, in his element, also taking into consideration 
                        that the branch he is going to is real. I made the birds also look in different directions to produce indifference 
                        and gave them different colour profile, the one on the right looks more washed compared to the more saturated and brighter colours. 
                        This was done to create contrast which in turn produces a story.

                    <p>In this piece, I had to be mindful of the colors I chose, as the abstract style makes it harder to create a sense of depth. 
                        By carefully selecting hues and layering them, I was able to maintain depth and ensure the composition remains balanced and engaging.

                    <p>In this piece, I used muted colors in the background to draw attention to the foreground, where bright yellow contrasts with the subtle tones of the landscape. 
                        The church, positioned in the bottom left according to the rule of thirds, which further directs the viewer’s focus. The abstract style enhances the loose, 
                        tranquil feel of the scene, perfectly complementing the peaceful atmosphere of the setting.

                    <p>In this watercolour piece I have put a skull which is reminiscent of death and decided to use an analogous colour harmony to produce serenity, 
                        since the colours in this scheme tend to flow together and easy to look at. The further you investigate colour the more you realise its 
                        psychological influence on us. It can affect our mood and choices. Blue is seen as a colour that creates a sense of safety and tranquillity, 
                        so I used it to give the impression that death doesn't have to be so scary and paralysing. Purple is often associated with being regal and spiritual. 
                        Which could make a person feel compassion and comprehension towards the subject, while also keeping the person grounded.

                    <p>In this piece we can see a tree with two individuals hanging from it, one of which is younger than the other. 
                        This makes us reflect on how there is no set age of who might have the desire to do something like this. 
                        The tree is used because it is a common symbol of life. Both are now spiritually connected to the tree, 
                        seen from how their blood is what it is watering it. Symmetry is used because of the sense of unity it creates. 
                        This unity gives us evidence about how we aren’t alone regarding our feelings and should reach out if we ever feel the need to.
